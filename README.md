  * Horizontal swipe sections (products, collections, tabs)
  * Touch-friendly spacing
  * Mobile-only UI components (scrollable category pills)
  * Optimized header layout (brand + icons first, search below)

The UX is inspired by production ecommerce platforms like **CaratLane, Tanishq, and Myntra**.
